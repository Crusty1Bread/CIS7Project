# CIS7Project

Hello!
This is the final project for our CIS7 class by Cristian Vargas and Berenice Acevedo

In this project we completed the task of determining where doctors in the UCR Medical program can be sent for their medical services abroad
based on their language fluency. 

Within this project you will find a C++ project. In order to run the program, you can download the project and run it in Visual Studio
or simply take the main project .cpp file and run that in a pre-existing C++ project.

I hope you enjoy our project!
